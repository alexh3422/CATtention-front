## Usage
Usage for this app is quite simple. Upon following the link you are greeted with a landing page prompting you to register. After signing up, you can either create a room or join one a friend has made. Once in the room, the timer starts when the button is pressed. While that timer runs, the user works. Once the timer is up, they are prompted with a trivia game. Users can level up their profiles by using the app more and can earn cat badges as they level up. You can work by yourself or with a couple friends! Use the live chat to talk to your friends or coworkers and level up together!
